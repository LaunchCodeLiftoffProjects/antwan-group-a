    <p>Greater St. Louis is a bi-state metropolitan area that completely surrounds and includes the independent
      city of St. Louis, the principal city. It includes parts of both Missouri and Illinois. The city core is
      on the Mississippi Riverfront on the border with Illinois in the geographic center of the metro area.
      Its iconic, 630-ft. Gateway Arch, built in the 1960s, honors the early 19th-century explorations of Lewis
      and Clark and America's westward expansion in general.
      As of 2020, the St. Louis MSA is the 21st-largest in the nation with a population of 2,820,253.
      The larger CSA is ranked 20th-largest in the United States, with a population of 2,909,003.
